Basic instructions to install the ND PHP Framework


1. Debian Installation

 Perform the following commands as super-user:

  # apt-get install php5-mysql php5-mcrypt
  # php5enmod mcrypt
  # service apache2 restart
  # mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -uroot -p mysql


2. Apache Settings

 Set 'AllowOverride all' on project VirtualHost directory.


3. PHP Settings

 Edit the /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file and set the following variables:

  max_input_vars = 20000
  auto_detect_line_endings = On
  memory_limit = 256M

 If the project is balanced with multiple web-servers, also set:

  session.use_trans_sid = 1


4. Database Configuration

 Create a new database and user under MySQL / MariaDB, granting all privileges
 to the user under the created database.


5. ND PHP Framework Settings

 If the installation process displays a warning stating that there are no write
 permissions on certain directories or files, grant that the user running the
 web-server can write on these directories or files.

 Always grant that system timezone is the same as set on the active
 Configuration timezone. Also grant that the DBMS is operating under the
 same timezone as the web-server.
